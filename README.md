# Bee-Monitoring-System
Monitors two beehives' entry and exit activity using 8 IR sensors via Arduino Mega. A Python GUI logs and displays real-time in/out detections and saves it to a CSV file.

Add the sensors on the reducer or directly on the entrance of the beehive in a non-disruptive manner.



The python program should automatically save a CSV file named "bee_log.csv" containing all of the data logged by the system.
